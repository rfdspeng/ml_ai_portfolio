You probably want to make sure this dataset works for both intent and NER.

Direct book queries - get metadata (if any), filter (what happens if your filter returns nothing? E.g. what if they misspell something. Is there some library that can fix misspellings, or should I let the chatbot do that? Should I prompt the user to fix?), and retrieve search results. Perhaps filter by title, series, author, etc. for each piece of metadata just to make sure you don't miss something.

Direct book queries that ask for something similar to something else - look up the reference, retrieve metadata, filter, and retrieve search results
* I really liked Circe (by Madeline Miller). Do you have any books like Circe?

---

Ambiguous queries - chatbot asks for clarification or additional info. Give chatbot dataset information (like genres, top 10 most popular, etc.)
* Good morning, I was wondering if you could help me.
* Hello! I'm looking for a book.
* Can you recommend something?
* I'm in the mood for something light and funny.

Dataset queries - maybe provide some precomputed dataset information, but then also include agentic functions (like pandas) for the LLM
* Do you have books in other languages?

---


Synthetic samples
* Start with as many real samples as possible per category
* Use API to generate synthetic samples (check for bad synthetic samples) - maybe around 500 - 1000 total per category
	* Use prompt engineering
* Data augmentation
	* Paraphrasing
	* Slang
	* Introduce typos and misspellings (check random or textattack library)
	* Translate to different language and back?
	* Add support for more languages later
* Use batch API to practice


Alternative phrasing, typos, slang

Handling follow-up queries to not retrieve the same books as in the original query:
1. Maintain a session or user history of previously recommended books (e.g. book IDs or titles) and filter these books out during retrieval process.
2. Some others that aren't immediately obvious how to work.

Metadata query (e.g. Do you have books in other languages?) - precompute the metadata and store it in JSON, SQLite, or a structured format. Route detected metadata queries to a simple lookup function rather than a full retrieval step.

System-related queries (e.g. How do your recommendations work?) - 
* Hardcode a small FAQ response set and route to a predefined response.
* Store common system-related FAQs in a small database (even JSON file is fine). Perform a similarity search on the FAQ database rather than book retrieval.

Outdated information (e.g. What are some best-selling books of the year?)
* Explicitly state the dataset's last update - metadata retrieval/FAQ
* Retrieve the most recent books available
* Integrate an API to get external data when needed

System flow
1. Intent classification: classify the query as (retrieval needed, metadata query, system query, outdated query, etc.)
2. Decision layer
	* If retrieval needed, proceed with standard retrieval
	* If metadata/system query, route to predefined responses or FAQ
	* If outdated, provide best available data but acknowledge the limitation
3. Chatbot
