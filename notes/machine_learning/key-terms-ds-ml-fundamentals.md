# Bias-variance tradeoff

Data bias, model bias

There are two sources of information: the model assumptions (bias) and the training data. Check CS229 lectures.

The relationship 

# Data bias

When the data is not representative of the real-world population or phenomenon being studied.

Sampling bias, other types of bias

# Generalization error

# Parametric vs. non-parametric learning algorithms

I think model-based learning can be parametric (e.g. linear regression) or non-parametric (e.g. decision trees), but instance-based learning (e.g. KNN) is always non-parametric.

What makes decision trees non-parametric?
