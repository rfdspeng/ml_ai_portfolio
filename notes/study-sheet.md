What are all the components of a learning algorithm? Data, model, hyperparameters? Objective function, optimization

Bias-variance analysis, sources of bias

Go over CS229 notes on validation/cross-validation

data leakage, target leakage - I bet if a feature has 100% correlation with target, this is target leakage. https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/data-leakage

EDA - different correlations

Transforming skewed distributions by taking log

Curse of dimensionality/number of features to number of samples
* Each feature is like a random variable - you want many samples per feature so you can see the underlying pattern and reduce noise

when I draw plots in a Python script, how are the plots rendered? Interactive vs. non-interactive, backend

Hands-on ML
* Chapter 1 exercises
