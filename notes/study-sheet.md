What are all the components of a learning algorithm? Data, model, hyperparameters? Objective function, optimization

Bias-variance analysis

Go over CS229 notes on validation/cross-validation

data leakage, target leakage

Curse of dimensionality/number of features to number of samples
* Each feature is like a random variable - you want many samples per feature so you can see the underlying pattern and reduce noise

when I draw plots in a Python script, how are the plots rendered? Interactive vs. non-interactive, backend

Hands-on ML
