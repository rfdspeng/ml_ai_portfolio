# Something to be aware of when grouping tests inside classes is that each test has a unique instance of the class. 
# Having each test share the same class instance would be very detrimental to test isolation and would promote poor test practices. 
# This is outlined below:

class TestClassDemoInstance:
    value = 0

    def test_one(self):
        self.value = 1
        assert self.value == 1

    def test_two(self):
        assert self.value == 1

# Note that attributes added at class level are class attributes, so they will be shared between tests.
